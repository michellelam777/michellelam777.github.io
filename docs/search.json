    "text": "Importance of Energy Storage\nEnergy storage is one of the major technologies being deployed in the hopes of decarbonizing our electricity sector. According to a study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), storage costs are projected to decline by as much as 58% by 2050, making this technology, in theory, more viable for widespread adoption.1 Utilities, energy producers, local, and state governments are banking on adoption of behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage systems (BESS) to reduce the demand for electricity on our aging grid infrastructure and to meet climate resiliency goals. Behind-the-meter battery energy storage systems refers to “customer-sited stationary storage systems that are connected to the distribution system on the customer’s side of the utility’s service meter”.2 For the sake of brevity, I will refer to behind-the-meter battery energy storage systems as “batteries” or “energy storage” throughout this discussion.\n\n\nSGIP and Equity\nIn an effort to promote distributed energy resources (DER), which includes batteries, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) created the Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP). In September of 2019, the CPUC announced that it would allocate additional funding for the “Equity” budget category and create a new “Equity Resiliency” budget category. The CPUC states that the goal for the equity budget is to ensure a “significant portion of the SGIP budget is reserved for customer projects in disadvantaged and low-income communities”3, whereas the goal for the equity resiliency budget is to help communities that are in high fire risk areas, people that are on a medical baseline rate (reduced energy rates for those that use more energy due to medical conditions), and those with “serious illness or condition that could become life threatening if service is disconnected”.4 Studies have also shown that there is a disproportionate effect of Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) on lower socioeconomic communities.5 Having a battery could help reduce some of the resulting negative impacts of power outages on these communities (e.g. food insecurity). Although this policy has good intentions, there are still socioeconomic disparities in SGIP utilization and subsequent energy storage adoption in California. (see Figure 1)\n\nFigure 1. Battery adoption rate and SGIP incentive rate by median household income and race/ethnicity. From David P. Brown. “Socioeconomic and demographic disparities in residential battery storage adoption: Evidence from California.” Energy Policy, Volume 164, 2022, 112877, ISSN 0301-4215\n\n\nData Behind Program Eligibility\nEligibility for residential SGIP projects under the equity funding category are partly based on income limits from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).6 HUD income limits are calculated based on American Community Survey (ACS) data,7 which collects data by taking a random sample of addresses to survey. Basing eligibility requirements on this data bring up questions of how the data is collected and issues of missing data. Data may be missed by systematically not including certain addresses or there may be inaccurate data if addresses incorrectly report income. This could be due to a number of reasons such as language barriers and self reporting issues. Eligibility for SGIP under equity funding is also based on whether you are located in “Indian Country in California” as defined by 18 USC 1151.8 While the inclusion of these lands can be beneficial, there are still disputes around federal reservation status without which indigenous communities might not be able to take advantage of the rebate.\nEligibility for residential SGIP projects under the equity resiliency funding are partly based on if your home is located in a high fire risk area or area that experienced two or more PSPS events.9 The development of the High Fire Threat District (HFTD) map included use of various forecasting models such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the GridFire model.10 Aside from the potential for inaccuracies in the map due to the massive amounts of data being collected, calculated, and spatially resolved, the use of modeling tools like these call into question who determines what goes into and what is excluded from the model? How are the biases of the creators of these models affecting the outcome of the map and subsequent eligibility in SGIP?\n\n\nCommunity Involvement\nIn order to increase participation in the equity SGIP budget, the CPUC did seek comments from different organizations, utilities, businesses, and community choice aggregations (CCAs). However, getting input from individual community members that are supposed to be benefiting from this policy is key in ensuring participation in this program. As we have seen with the Guadalupe Community Air Monitoring Project,11 community involvement and ownership is crucial in creating robust programs that create substantive change. Not only should community members voice feedback, but they should also be involved throughout the whole information value chain. This means active participation of community members in the upstream processes of data capture and processing through citizen science that will inform decisions on eligibility requirements and program implementation. In addition to that, they should be integral in the decision making process for policy and dissemination of the program. Having the community perspective in policy decisions will also help the CPUC take a step back and evaluate other more foundational aspects of the policy to boost enrollment (i.e. looking beyond eligibility requirements). For example, this program requires the battery be installed before receiving funding, which is a tough upfront cost for lower income communities to face. Additionally, homeownership is key in getting a battery installed. Many of the target individuals for the equity budget are renters, and therefore need to convince their landlords to first install the battery and then apply for the rebate. Lastly, from personal experience working at a solar company and helping customers apply for this program, the process to submit and receive the rebate is very lengthy and requires jumping through a lot of hoops. Is there something that can be done to lower these barriers to participation and ultimate adoption of batteries?\n\n\nChallenges and Next Steps\nOne other challenge the program faces is the fact that data is evaluated and decisions are made on a statewide level. Organizing and managing citizen science on the neighborhood level is helpful to get finer resolution data and solutions that work for specific communities, but aggregating it back up to policy on the state level could prove difficult. The CPUC could consider varying program requirements based on different locations or groups in California based on community feedback. Closer examination of the data utilized for SGIP brings up concerns and questions around missing data, inaccurate data, and biased modeling that may affect target communities’ participation in the program. To combat these concerns, the CPUC should employ citizen science methods and involve community members to create, adjust, and remove parts of the policy to ensure real change.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCole, Wesley, Will A.

    "text": "The Question\n\nWhat is the effect of income on SGIP applications?\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nEnergy storage is poised for rapid growth and will play a major role in the decarbonization of our energy industry. 1 The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) created the Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), in part, to provide rebates to people and organizations looking to install energy storage systems. In September of 2019, they introduced additional funding for the “Equity” budget and a new funding category, “Equity Resiliency”. These funding categories aim to help lower-income, medically vulnerable, and at risk for fire communities pay for a battery. 2 Given that lower socioeconomic communities are shown to experience more frequent Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS), 3 an energy storage system could be critical to avoiding the adverse effects of a power outage (e.g. food insecurity). There has been a study showing the socioeconomic disparities in residential battery storage adoption, 4 but there hasn’t been targeted analysis on SGIP participation post equity and equity resiliency funding becoming available.\nExamining if there is an effect of income on SGIP applications for 2020, could help inform the effectiveness of the new funding categories and subsequent policy decisions.\n\n\nData\n\nSGIP Applications\nI downloaded SGIP application data from the California Distributed Energy Statistics site. 5 Application data is reported on a weekly basis via an excel file. For this analysis, SGIP applications were filtered down to just residential and single family battery applications for 2020. The data was then summarized by zip code to get total count of applications for each zip code. I did notice that the metadata didn’t always correctly specify the categorical values in each variable, so there is room for error in categorization.\nWhen visualizing SGIP applications for 2020, 43.14% of applications fall under the Equity and Equity Resiliency categories.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#loading the necessary pacakges\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(car)\n\n#setting file path for root directory\nrootdir <- (\"/Users/michelle/Documents/UCSB Grad School/Courses/eds_222/eds222_final_project\")\ndatadir <-(file.path(rootdir,\"data\"))\n\n#store and set API key to access tidycensus\ncensus_token <- Sys.getenv('CENSUS_KEY')\ncensus_api_key(census_token)\n\n#read in the SGIP data\nsgip <- read_csv(file.path(datadir,\"sgip_weekly_data.csv\")) |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n#filter down to rebates for just residential electrochemcial storage that were not cancelled, format date and zip\nsgip_res_battery <- sgip |> \n  filter(equipment_type == \"Electrochemical Storage\", host_customer_sector %in% c(\"Residential\", \"Single Family\"), budget_classification != \"Cancelled\") |>\n  select(\"city\", \"county\", \"zip\", \"date_received\", \"budget_category\", \"host_customer_sector\") |> \n  mutate(\"date_received\" = str_sub(date_received, 1, 8)) |> \n  mutate(\"date_received\" = as.Date(date_received, format = \"%m/%d/%y\")) |>\n  mutate(\"year_received\" = year(date_received)) |>\n  mutate(\"month_received\" = month(date_received)) |> \n  mutate(\"zip\" = ifelse(\n    str_length(zip) == 10, \n    substring(zip, 1, nchar(zip)-5),\n    zip))\n\n#create sgip dataset filtered for 2020\nsgip_2020 <- sgip_res_battery |> \n  filter(year_received == 2020)\n\n# create dataframe showing count of applications in each zip code for 2020\nsgip_zip_2020 <- sgip_2020 |> \n  group_by(zip) |> \n  summarize(count = n())\n\n#create a summary data frame showing applications by budget category\nsgip_2020_budget <- sgip_2020 |> \n  group_by(budget_category) |> \n  summarize(count = n()) |> \n  mutate(percent = round(((count/sum(count))*100),2), percent_label = paste0(percent, \"%\"))\n\n#plot percent SGIP applications by category\nggplot(sgip_2020_budget, aes(y = budget_category, x = percent)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue3\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percent of SGIP Applications in Each Budget Category (2020)\", y = \"Budget Category\", x = \"Percent of Applications\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  geom_label(label = sgip_2020_budget$percent_label)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS)\nI accessed American Community Survey (ACS) data containing per capita income and population for each census tract in California through an API and the tidycensus package in R.6 ACS data is provided in tabular format and is read in as a data frame. ACS utilizes a stratified sampling approach, using address blocks to create strata.7 This could run the risk of the sample not reflecting the population if strata have overlapping characteristics. Additionally, data might not be as available/reliable for rural areas.8\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#access ACS data variables for 2020 year \nv20 <- load_variables(2020, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE)\n\n#read in per capita income data for census tracts in CA\nca_pc_income_tract <- get_acs(geography = \"tract\",\n                            variables = c(percapita_income = \"B19301_001\"),\n                            state = \"CA\",\n                            year = 2020)\n\n#clean and format per capita income data frame\nca_pc_income_tract_clean <- ca_pc_income_tract |> \n  select(c(\"GEOID\", \"NAME\", \"estimate\")) |> \n  rename(percapita_income = \"estimate\")\n\n#read in population data for census tracts in CA\nca_pop_tract <- get_acs(geography = \"tract\",\n                        variables = c(population = \"B01003_001\"),\n                        state = \"CA\",\n                        year = 2020)\n\n#clean and format population data frame \nca_pop_tract_clean <- ca_pop_tract |> \n  select(c(\"GEOID\", \"NAME\", \"estimate\")) |> \n  rename(population = \"estimate\")\n\n#combine per capita income and population data frames\ncombine_census <- cbind(ca_pc_income_tract_clean, ca_pop_tract_clean$population) |> \n  rename(population = \"ca_pop_tract_clean$population\", tract = \"GEOID\")\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nI downloaded the crosswalk file in the form of a csv from the U.S. HUD site. 9 The file relates zip codes to census tracts and was utilized to match up application data (zip code level) to per capita income and population data (census tract level).\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#read in crosswalk file to use when matching zip codes to census tracts\ncrosswalk <- read_csv(file.path(datadir,\"ZIP_TRACT_122020.csv\")) |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nTo analyze the effect of income on SGIP applications, I utilized the three datasets outlined above to create a data frame showing applications per thousand people and per capita income for each zip code. When aggregating from census tract level to zip code level, I took the median per capita income and summed the populations in each census tract to get income and population variables for each zip code. I used population of each zip code to calculate the applications per thousand people in order to account for the fact that higher income areas have more people and to create a more appropriate scale for interpretation. I did notice that after combining the datasets, there were 1,933 NA values for per capita income and 1,896 NA values for population out of the 10,978 census tracts in the dataset. This could lead to inaccuracies since observations are analyzed on the zip code level and aggregation of the census tract data was performed.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#combine sgip_zip_2020 and crosswalk file by zip to get a data frame with sgip applications per census tract\n#because there are multiple census tracts for one zip code, use the res_ratio to allocate what portion of the count of SGIP applications should be allocated to one census tract\nsgip_zip_census <- left_join(sgip_zip_2020, crosswalk, by = \"zip\") |> \n  mutate(\"count_adjusted\" = count*res_ratio) #now we have theoretical count of applications per census tract\n\n#combine sgip_zip_census with acs data by tract\ncombined_all <- left_join(sgip_zip_census, combine_census, by = \"tract\") |> \n  mutate(\"percapita_application\" = count_adjusted/population) |>\n  mutate(\"applications_per_thousand\" = (count_adjusted/population)*1000) |> \n  select(c(-\"oth_ratio\", -\"tot_ratio\", -\"bus_ratio\"))\n\n#take the combined_all data frame and consolidate back to apps per zip (averaging per capita income and summing population of each census tract into zip codes)\ncombined_by_zip <- combined_all |> \n  group_by(zip) |> \n  summarize(applications = mean(count, na.rm = TRUE), percapita_income = median(percapita_income, na.rm = TRUE), population = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE)) |> \n  filter(!is.na(percapita_income)) |> \n  mutate(\"applications_per_1000_people\" = (applications/population)*1000, \"percapita_application\" = applications/population)\n\n\n\nRegression Models\nNext, I ran different regression models to see what would best fit the data. I started with a simple linear regression, but noticed that the median per capita income and the applications per thousand people observations were not normally distributed with a right tail (see supporting figures). Therefore, I ran a linear-log regression and log-log regression. The residuals from these models were not normally distributed so I ran a polynomial regression. The residuals on the polynomial regression were not normal either (see supporting figures), but I concluded that the polynomial regression was best fit since visually the slope doesn’t look constant and the coefficients were significant. Here is the equation for the model: \\[application_i =\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\cdot income_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot income_i^2 + \\varepsilon_i\\]\nI did notice that there was an outlier in the dataset, but when I removed the outlier and ran the polynomial regression it did not change the significance of the coefficients. Because the outlier didn’t drastically change model results and there was no evidence that this data point was an outlier caused by data entry or measurement errors, I left it in.\nAs mentioned above, on all the models tested the residuals were not normally distributed with a long right tail. This means that the amount of error in the model is not consistent across the full range of my observed data and the model’s ability to accurately predict applications per thousand people at a given median per capita income could be low.\n\n\nHypothesis Testing\nI jointly tested the \\(\\beta_{1}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) coefficients using the linearHypothesis() function from the car package to test for no relationship between median per capita income and applications per thousand people.\n\\(H_0: \\beta_{1} = 0, \\beta_{2} = 0\\)\n\\(H_A: \\beta_{j}\\neq 0\\) for at least one \\(j = 1,2\\)\n\n\n\nResults\n\nPolynomial Regression\nFrom the below outputs of the model, I can see that the coefficient of per capita income is statistically significant at the 0.1% significance level (p-value = 0.0003) and the coefficient of per capita income squared is statistically significant at the 1% significance level (p-value = 0.0088). The R squared and adjusted R squared are really low at 0.022 and 0.02, respectively. This means that 2% of the variability in applications per thousand people is explained by median per capita income. Having a low R squared value and a high significance for the coefficients in the model could mean that there is a statistically significant relationship between applications and income, but the predictive accuracy of the model is low.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#polynomial regression\npoly_model <- lm(applications_per_1000_people ~ percapita_income + I(percapita_income^2), data = combined_by_zip)\n\n#store all the values of the model \nR2_poly_model = summary(poly_model)$r.squared\nR2_poly_adjusted = summary(poly_model)$adj.r.squared\n\nintercept_poly <- summary(poly_model)$coefficients[\"(Intercept)\", \"Estimate\"]\nb1_poly <- summary(poly_model)$coefficients[\"percapita_income\", \"Estimate\"]\nb2_poly <- summary(poly_model)$coefficients[\"I(percapita_income^2)\", \"Estimate\"]\n\nPredictors <- c(\"Intercept\", \"per capita income\", \"(per capita income)^2\")\nEstimate <- signif(summary(poly_model)$coefficients[,\"Estimate\"], digits = 3)\nSE <- signif(summary(poly_model)$coefficients[,\"Std.

When moving from a median per capita income of $60,000 to $70,000 (middle income), predicted applications per thousand people increases by 0.06.

It is hard to definitely say that the SGIP program is or is not helping lower income communities since the slope of the model increases up until a certain point and then decreases. From previous research mentioned in the introduction, I would have thought the slope of the model would be consistently positive. This would have shown that the SGIP program was being utilized less by low income communities. The model does, however, conclude that the lowest income communities are not utilizing the SGIP program. This can be due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, energy storage systems often being paired with solar, requirements of home ownership, and a lengthy rebate process that are barriers to adoption of this program. Some further analysis that would help determine if the equity and equity resiliency funding is helping low income communities is to compare pre 2020 applications to post 2020 applications to get a sense of the change in program participation among low income communities. Also adding medical vulnerability and wildfire risk as predictors to the model could indicate if those communities are utilizing the program and control for interactions between income and these additional variables.\nCheck out the full code in my repo: https://github.com/michellelam777/eds222_final_project\n\n\nSupporting Figures\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#histogram for per capita income\nggplot(data = combined_by_zip) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(percapita_income), fill = \"skyblue3\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Median Per Capita Income\", labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Median Per Capita Income (2020)\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#histogram for applications per 1000 people\nggplot(data = combined_by_zip) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(applications_per_1000_people), fill = \"skyblue3\") +\n  labs(x = \"SGIP Applictions Per Thousand People\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Applications Per Thousand People (2020)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#get a predicted value for every observation (generate a column of predictions called pred)\n#then use predictions to compute residuals (actual - prediction) -> add column called residuals\npredictions_4 <- combined_by_zip |> \n  add_predictions(poly_model) |> \n  mutate(residuals = applications_per_1000_people - pred)\n\n#test assumption that errors are normally distributed\npoly_residuals_hist <- ggplot(data = predictions_4) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(residuals)) +\n  labs(title = \"Residuals from Polynomial Model\", x = \"(apps ~ income + income^2) residuals\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\npoly_income_qq <- ggplot(data = predictions_4,\n       aes(sample = residuals)) +\n  geom_qq() +\n  geom_qq_line() +\n  labs(title = \"QQ Plot Polynomial Model Residuals\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ngrid.arrange(poly_residuals_hist, poly_income_qq, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBlair, Nate, Chad Augustine, Wesley Cole, et al. 2022.

    "text": "Research Questions\n\nHow many Houston homes lost power as a result of the 2021 winter storms in Texas? Is median household income a predictor of community recovery? Were there disproportionate affects on medically vulnerable communities?\n\n\n\nBackground\nSevere winter storms hit Texas February 10th through the 20th in 2021, producing the “worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas state history”.1 Millions of homes lost power, resulting in at least 57 deaths and over $195 billion in property damage.2 As climate change increases the frequency and severity of natural disasters that lead to power outages, environmental justice concerns arise around community recovery and resiliency. Studies have shown median household income to be significant predictors of recovery time 3 and power outages place electricity-dependent individuals (e.g. those with disabilities needing electricity to run medical equipment or refrigeration to store medicine) at higher risk for adverse health outcomes.4 Focusing analysis on Houston, the most populous city in Texas 5, we can use overlay spatial data to quantify how many residents lost power and the potential socioeconomic disparities in those affected by the power outage.\n\n\nData\n\nVIIRS data from NASA\nTo determine which areas experienced an outage, VIIRS data distributed through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC) is utilized. After filtering out images with too much cloud cover, 2021-02-07 (pre outage) and 2021-02-16 (post outage) provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\nThis NASA Earth data product is distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06, so there will be two tiles per date.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#load required packages\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\n\n# Set filepath\nrootdir <- (\"/Users/michelle/Documents/UCSB Grad School/Courses/eds_223\")\ndatadir <- file.path(rootdir,\"data\")\n\n#accessing stored API key for census data\ncensus_token <- Sys.getenv('CENSUS_KEY')\ncensus_api_key(census_token)\n\n#load in night lights tiles from 2021-02-07 \nnight_lights1 <- read_stars(file.path(datadir,\"VNP46A1\",\"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\"))\n\nnight_lights2 <- read_stars(file.path(datadir,\"VNP46A1\",\"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\"))\n\n#combine tiles for 2021-02-07 \ncombined_feb_7 <- st_mosaic(night_lights1, night_lights2)\n\n#load in night lights tiles from 2021-02-16\nnight_lights3 <- read_stars(file.path(datadir,\"VNP46A1\",\"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\"))\n\nnight_lights4 <- read_stars(file.path(datadir,\"VNP46A1\",\"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\"))\n\n#combine tiles for 2021-02-16\ncombined_feb_16 <- st_mosaic(night_lights3, night_lights4)\n\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMap Data\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a project that provides free, publicly available geographic data of the world. This analysis uses OSM roads and building data taken from Geofabrik’s download sites. Roads and building data are shapefiles that are provided via a Geopackage (.gpkg file).\n\nHighways/Roads\nBecause highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space, areas near highways are ignored in order to minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#define the SQL query and load in highways dataset\nquery <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\nhighways <- st_read(file.path(datadir,\"gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\"), query = query)\n\n#reproject highways data to EPSG: 3083\nhighways <- st_transform(highways, crs = 3083)\n\n\n\n\nBuildings/Houses\nTo understand which houses were effected by the power outages, a spatial dataset indicating locations of houses for the Houston metropolitan area is utilized.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#define buildings_query and load in buildings dataset\nbuildings_query <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL) OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\"\n\nbuildings <- st_read(file.path(datadir,\"gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\"), query = buildings_query)\n\n#reproject buildings data to EPSG: 3083\nbuildings <- st_transform(buildings, crs = 3083)\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) Data\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) is a demographics survey program conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This program gathers information on a regular, more frequent, basis than the long form decennial census.\n\nMedian Household Income\n2019 median household income data for each census tract in the Houston area is utilized to understand how socioeconomic factors might play a role in a communities ability to recover from power outages. Income data is provided through an ArcGIS “file geodatabase”. The geodatabase includes layers holding ACS attributes and a separate layer holding the geometry information.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#read in the geometries layer of the ACS data and reproject to EPSG: 3083\nacs_geom <- st_read(file.path(datadir, \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"), layer = \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS\")\nacs_geom <- st_transform(acs_geom, crs = 3083)\n\n#read in the income layer of the ACS data\nacs_income <- st_read(file.path(datadir, \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\"), layer = \"X19_INCOME\")\n\n#keep only GEOID and B19013e1 column in the ACS income data, rename B19013e1 column to median income\nacs_income_clean <- acs_income |> \n  select(c(\"GEOID\", \"B19013e1\")) |> \n  rename(\"median_income\" = \"B19013e1\")\n\n\n\n\nMedical Vulnerability\nThe “one or more disability items allocated” attribute in combination with census tract population from the 2020 ACS is used to see if impacted tracts have a higher population of medically vulnerable people. This data will be accessed through an API and tidycensus package in R. Tidycensus returns a dataframe with desired attributes and geometry column.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#access ACS data variables for 2020 year \nv20 <- load_variables(2020, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE)\n\npopulation <- get_acs(\n  state = \"Texas\",\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = \"B99181_001\",\n  geometry = TRUE, \n  year = 2020\n)\n\npopulation_clean <- population |> \n  select(\"GEOID\", \"NAME\", \"estimate\", \"geometry\") |> \n  rename(population = \"estimate\")\n\ndisability <- get_acs(\n  state = \"Texas\", \n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = \"B99181_002\",\n  geometry = TRUE, \n  year = 2020\n)\n\ndisability_clean <- disability |> \n  select(\"GEOID\", \"NAME\", \"estimate\", \"geometry\") |> \n  rename(disabled = \"estimate\")\n\nacs_disability <- cbind(disability_clean, population_clean$population) |> \n  rename(population = \"population_clean.population\") |> \n  mutate(percent_disabled = (disabled/population)*100)\n\nacs_disability <- st_transform(acs_disability, crs = 3083)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nIn order to find the homes that were impacted by the blackout, I created a blackout mask by doing some map algebra. I subtracted the February 16th raster from the February 7th raster to get a raster containing the change in night lights intensity. I assume that any location that had a drop of more than 200 nW cm-2sr-1 experienced a blackout. Under this assumption, I recalssified the change in night lights intensity raster so that any location with a blackout holds a value of 1 and anywhere else is NA. Then, I vectorized the mask and cropped the mask to the area of interest (in this case the Houston metropolitan area). Here are the coordinates used (-96.5, 29), (-96.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 29). To account for the roads and highways, I created a 200m buffer around each highway and excluded them from the blackout mask. Lastly, I spatially joined the blackout mask with the buildings data to get the number of homes that experienced a blackout.\nIn order to investigate if median household income is a predictor for recovery, I joined income data to census tract geometries and used the blackout mask from the analysis above to find which census tracts experienced blackouts. The distribution of income in the impacted vs unimpacted tracts can then be compared and a map was produced to visualize the findings.\nIn order to explore if impacted tracts had a higher percentage of people with disabilities, I spatially intersected disability data from ACS with the blackout mask created in the first part of the analysis. This resulting sf object can then be utilized to map relative percentages of disabled people in each census tract and impacted census tracts. Additionally, I visualized the distribution of percent disabled census tracts and calculated the average percent disabled in impacted vs. unimpacted tracts.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#Find the difference between the two rasters (subtracting feb 16 from feb 7 values to get positive values - i.e. nW cm^-2sr^-1 is higher on feb 7 than on feb 16)\nchange_nli <- combined_feb_7-combined_feb_16\n\n#check out the change_nli object to see the min and max values\nchange_nli\n\n#create a reclassification matrix\n#set lowest value in range to -3120 and highest to 3000 based on the min and max values of the change_nli object\n#a drop of less than 200 becomes 0 (i.e. no blackout), a drop of more than 200 becomes 1 (i.e.  blackout)\nrcl_matrix <- data.frame(from = c(-3120,200), to = c(199, 3000), becomes = 0:1)\nrcl_matrix\n\n#reclassify the change_nli with the matrix created above. \nrcl_change_nli <- cut(change_nli, breaks = c(-3200, rcl_matrix$to), labels = rcl_matrix$becomes)\nrcl_change_nli\n\n#set 0 (non blackout areas) to NAs \nrcl_change_nli[rcl_change_nli == 0] = NA\n\n#vectorize the blackout mask\nvect_mask <- st_as_sf(rcl_change_nli) |> \n  st_make_valid()\n\n#define Houston area\nhouston_coord <- rbind(c(-96.5, 29), c(-94.5, 29), c(-94.5, 30.5), c(-96.5,30.5), c(-96.5, 29))\n\n#turn Houston coordinates into a polygon\nhouston_poly <- st_polygon(list(houston_coord))\n\n#checkout the CRS of the vect_mask\ncrs(vect_mask)\n\n#convert Houston polygon to simple feature collection and assign the CRS to EPSG: 4326 (same CRS as the vect_mask)\nhouston_geom <- st_sfc(houston_poly, crs = 4326)\n\n#crop blackout mask to region of interest and reproject to EPSG: 3083\nblackout_mask_crop <- vect_mask[houston_geom,] |> \n  st_transform(crs = 3083)\n\n#remove unnecessary columns of highways data frame to create a smaller highways dataframe so it doesn't crash R\nhighways_clean <- highways$geom\n\n#create a 200m buffer around highways and reproject to EPSG: 3083\nhighway_buffer <- st_union(st_buffer(highways_clean, dist = 200))\n\n#find areas that experienced blackouts further than 200m from a highway (note: I used st_disjoint to make sure that houses touching the buffer were not included. Alternatively, you could use st_difference and get houses that touch or are on the buffer line.)\nblackout_highway <- blackout_mask_crop[highway_buffer, ,op = st_disjoint]\n\n#find homes within blackout areas\nblackout_homes <- buildings[blackout_highway,]\n\n#join income data to census tract geometries\nacs_combined <- left_join(acs_geom, acs_income_clean, by = c(\"GEOID_Data\" = \"GEOID\"))\n\n#spatially join census tract data with blackout_homes dataset to get a data frame of census tracts with blackouts, keep only the GEOID_Data and median income, and add a blackout column (used later on for a left_join)\nblackout_acs <- acs_combined[blackout_homes,] |> \n  select(c(\"GEOID_Data\", \"median_income\")) |> \n  mutate(blackout = \"blackout\") \n\n\n\n\nResults\nI have calculated a total of 139,103 houses in Houston that lost power as a result of the first two storms. The resulting distributions and calculated averages of impacted vs. unimpacted tracts’ median household income show that impacted tracts had a slightly higher median income (average = $71,462) than the unimpacted census tracts (average = $67,436). This seems a little counter intuitive, but when looking at the data more closely I can see there are a higher number of outliers (i.e. more households with the $250,000 income range) in the impacted tracts which could be pulling the average up. Additionally, when examining if there is a difference in disabled percent across unimpacted vs. impacted tracts, this initial analysis shows no real difference. The calculated mean percent disabled in the impacted tracts is 10.59 and in unimpacted it is 10.62.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#make the acs_combined dataset smaller for quicker

predictor of communities recovery from a power outages. However, from this short analysis, it seems like census tracts that experienced power outages were not more likely to contain a higher percentage of disabled individuals.\nSome limitations of this study include only having satellite imagery for 2 days, missing data for median income, and assumptions of a 200m buffer for highways and that a drop of 200 nW cm-2sr-1 constitutes a blackout. Disability data from ACS may not be an equivalent proxy for those that are electricity-dependent so future analysis could include more precise data on people that utilize rely on electric-powered medical equipment. Other indicators of recovery that would be interesting to look at include race/ethnicity and home age.\ncheckout the full code in my repo: https://github.com/michellelam777/texas-power-outage-analysis\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWikipedia. 2021. “2021 Texas power crisis.” Last modified October 2, 2021. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Texas_power_crisis.↩︎\nKing, Carey W, et al. “The Timeline and Events of the February 2021 Texas Electric Grid Blackouts.” Energy Institute | The University of Texas at Austin, July 2021, https://energy.utexas.edu/research/ercot-blackout-2021.↩︎\nBest, Kelsea, et al. “Spatial regression identifies socioeconomic inequality in multi-stage power outage recovery after Hurricane Isaac.” (2022).↩︎\nCasey, J.A., Fukurai, M., Hernández, D. et al. Power Outages and Community Health: a Narrative Review.
