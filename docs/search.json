    "text": "SGIP and Equity\nIn an effort to promote distributed energy resources (DER), which includes batteries, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) created the Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP). In September of 2019, the CPUC announced that it would allocate additional funding for the “Equity” budget category and create a new “Equity Resiliency” budget category. The CPUC states that the goal for the equity budget is to ensure a “significant portion of the SGIP budget is reserved for customer projects in disadvantaged and low-income communities”3, whereas the goal for the equity resiliency budget is to help communities that are in high fire risk areas, people that are on a medical baseline rate (reduced energy rates for those that use more energy due to medical conditions), and those with “serious illness or condition that could become life threatening if service is disconnected”.4 Studies have also shown that there is a disproportionate effect of Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) on lower socioeconomic communities.5 Having a battery could help reduce some of the resulting negative impacts of power outages on these communities (e.g. food insecurity). Although this policy has good intentions, there are still socioeconomic disparities in SGIP utilization and subsequent energy storage adoption in California. (see Figure 1)\n\nFigure 1. Battery adoption rate and SGIP incentive rate by median household income and race/ethnicity. From David P. Brown. “Socioeconomic and demographic disparities in residential battery storage adoption: Evidence from California.” Energy Policy, Volume 164, 2022, 112877, ISSN 0301-4215\n\n\nData Behind Program Eligibility\nEligibility for residential SGIP projects under the equity funding category are partly based on income limits from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).6 HUD income limits are calculated based on American Community Survey (ACS) data,7 which collects data by taking a random sample of addresses to survey. Basing eligibility requirements on this data bring up questions of how the data is collected and issues of missing data. Data may be missed by systematically not including certain addresses or there may be inaccurate data if addresses incorrectly report income. This could be due to a number of reasons such as language barriers and self reporting issues. Eligibility for SGIP under equity funding is also based on whether you are located in “Indian Country in California” as defined by 18 USC 1151.8 While the inclusion of these lands can be beneficial, there are still disputes around federal reservation status without which indigenous communities might not be able to take advantage of the rebate.\nEligibility for residential SGIP projects under the equity resiliency funding are partly based on if your home is located in a high fire risk area or area that experienced two or more PSPS events.9 The development of the High Fire Threat District (HFTD) map included use of various forecasting models such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the GridFire model.10 Aside from the potential for inaccuracies in the map due to the massive amounts of data being collected, calculated, and spatially resolved, the use of modeling tools like these call into question who determines what goes into and what is excluded from the model? How are the biases of the creators of these models affecting the outcome of the map and subsequent eligibility in SGIP?\n\n\nCommunity Involvement\nIn order to increase participation in the equity SGIP budget, the CPUC did seek comments from different organizations, utilities, businesses, and community choice aggregations (CCAs). However, getting input from individual community members that are supposed to be benefiting from this policy is key in ensuring participation in this program. As we have seen with the Guadalupe Community Air Monitoring Project,11 community involvement and ownership is crucial in creating robust programs that create substantive change. Not only should community members voice feedback, but they should also be involved throughout the whole information value chain. This means active participation of community members in the upstream processes of data capture and processing through citizen science that will inform decisions on eligibility requirements and program implementation. In addition to that, they should be integral in the decision making process for policy and dissemination of the program. Having the community perspective in policy decisions will also help the CPUC take a step back and evaluate other more foundational aspects of the policy to boost enrollment (i.e. looking beyond eligibility requirements). For example, this program requires the battery be installed before receiving funding, which is a tough upfront cost for lower income communities to face. Additionally, homeownership is key in getting a battery installed. Many of the target individuals for the equity budget are renters, and therefore need to convince their landlords to first install the battery and then apply for the rebate. Lastly, from personal experience working at a solar company and helping customers apply for this program, the process to submit and receive the rebate is very lengthy and requires jumping through a lot of hoops. Is there something that can be done to lower these barriers to participation and ultimate adoption of batteries?\n\n\nChallenges and Next Steps\nOne other challenge the program faces is the fact that data is evaluated and decisions are made on a statewide level. Organizing and managing citizen science on the neighborhood level is helpful to get finer resolution data and solutions that work for specific communities, but aggregating it back up to policy on the state level could prove difficult. The CPUC could consider varying program requirements based on different locations or groups in California based on community feedback. Closer examination of the data utilized for SGIP brings up concerns and questions around missing data, inaccurate data, and biased modeling that may affect target communities’ participation in the program. To combat these concerns, the CPUC should employ citizen science methods and involve community members to create, adjust, and remove parts of the policy to ensure real change.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCole, Wesley, Will A.

    "text": "Introduction\nEnergy storage is poised for rapid growth and will play a major role in the decarbonization of our energy industry. 1 The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) created the Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), in part, to provide rebates to people and organizations looking to install energy storage systems. In 2020, they introduced new funding categories that provide higher rebates under “Equity” and “Equity Resiliency” aimed to help lower-income, medically vulnerable, and at risk for fire communities pay for a battery. 2 Given that lower socioeconomic communities are shown to experience more frequent Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS), 3 an energy storage system could be critical to avoiding the adverse effects of a power outage (e.g. food insecurity). There has been a study showing the socioeconomic disparities in residential battery storage adoption, 4 but there hasn’t been targeted analysis on SGIP participation post equity and equity resiliency funding becoming available.\nExamining if there is an effect of income on SGIP applications for 2020, could help inform the effectiveness of the new funding categories and subsequent policy decisions.\n\n\nData\n\nSGIP Applications\nI downloaded SGIP application data from the California Distributed Energy Statistics site. 5 Application data is reported on a weekly basis via an excel file. For this analysis, SGIP applications were filtered down to just residential and single family battery applications for 2020. The data was then summarized by zip code to get total count of applications for each zip code. I did notice that the metadata didn’t always correctly specify the categorical values in each variable, so there is room for error in categorization.\nWhen visualizing SGIP applications for 2020 you can see that over 40% of applications fall under the Equity Resiliency category.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#loading the necessary pacakges\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(car)\n\n#setting file path for root directory\nrootdir <- (\"/Users/michelle/Documents/UCSB Grad School/Courses/eds_222/eds222_final_project\")\ndatadir <-(file.path(rootdir,\"data\"))\n\n#store and set API key to access tidycensus\ncensus_token <- Sys.getenv('CENSUS_KEY')\ncensus_api_key(census_token)\n\n#read in the SGIP data\nsgip <- read_csv(file.path(datadir,\"sgip_weekly_data.csv\")) |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n#filter down to rebates for just residential electrochemcial storage that were not cancelled, format date and zip\nsgip_res_battery <- sgip |> \n  filter(equipment_type == \"Electrochemical Storage\", host_customer_sector %in% c(\"Residential\", \"Single Family\"), budget_classification != \"Cancelled\") |>\n  select(\"city\", \"county\", \"zip\", \"date_received\", \"budget_category\", \"host_customer_sector\") |> \n  mutate(\"date_received\" = str_sub(date_received, 1, 8)) |> \n  mutate(\"date_received\" = as.Date(date_received, format = \"%m/%d/%y\")) |>\n  mutate(\"year_received\" = year(date_received)) |>\n  mutate(\"month_received\" = month(date_received)) |> \n  mutate(\"zip\" = ifelse(\n    str_length(zip) == 10, \n    substring(zip, 1, nchar(zip)-5),\n    zip))\n\n#create sgip dataset filtered for 2020\nsgip_2020 <- sgip_res_battery |> \n  filter(year_received == 2020)\n\n# create dataframe showing count of applications in each zip code for 2020\nsgip_zip_2020 <- sgip_2020 |> \n  group_by(zip) |> \n  summarize(count = n())\n\n#create a summary data frame showing applications by budget category\nsgip_2020_budget <- sgip_2020 |> \n  group_by(budget_category) |> \n  summarize(count = n()) |> \n  mutate(percent = round(((count/sum(count))*100),2))\n\n#plot percent SGIP applications by category\nggplot(sgip_2020_budget, aes(y = budget_category, x = percent)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue3\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percent of SGIP Applications in Each Budget Category (2020)\", y = \"Budget Category\", x = \"Percent of Applications\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS)\nI accessed American Community Survey (ACS) data containing per capita income and population for each census tract in California through an API and the tidycensus package in R.6 Some limitations of the ACS data include that it is collected by selecting a random sample of addresses and therefore is not a true census of the population and data might not be as available/reliable for rural areas.7\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#access ACS data variables for 2020 year \nv20 <- load_variables(2020, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE)\n\n#read in per capita income data for census tracts in CA\nca_pc_income_tract <- get_acs(geography = \"tract\",\n                            variables = c(percapita_income = \"B19301_001\"),\n                            state = \"CA\",\n                            year = 2020)\n\n#clean and format per capita income data frame\nca_pc_income_tract_clean <- ca_pc_income_tract |> \n  select(c(\"GEOID\", \"NAME\", \"estimate\")) |> \n  rename(percapita_income = \"estimate\")\n\n#read in population data for census tracts in CA\nca_pop_tract <- get_acs(geography = \"tract\",\n                        variables = c(population = \"B01003_001\"),\n                        state = \"CA\",\n                        year = 2020)\n\n#clean and format population data frame \nca_pop_tract_clean <- ca_pop_tract |> \n  select(c(\"GEOID\", \"NAME\", \"estimate\")) |> \n  rename(population = \"estimate\")\n\n#combine per capita income and population data frames\ncombine_census <- cbind(ca_pc_income_tract_clean, ca_pop_tract_clean$population) |> \n  rename(population = \"ca_pop_tract_clean$population\", tract = \"GEOID\")\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nI downloaded the crosswalk file in the form of a csv from the U.S. HUD site. 8 The file relates zip codes to census tracts and was utilized to match up application data (zip code level) to per capita income and population data (census tract level).\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#read in crosswalk file to use when matching zip codes to census tracts\ncrosswalk <- read_csv(file.path(datadir,\"ZIP_TRACT_122020.csv\")) |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nTo analyze the effect of income on SGIP applications, I utilized the three datasets outlined above to create a dataframe showing applications per thousand people and per capita income for each zip code. I used population of each zip code to calculate the applications per thousand people in order to account for the fact that higher income areas have more people and to create a more appropriate scale for interpretation.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#combine sgip_zip_2020 and crosswalk file by zip to get a data frame with sgip applications per census tract\n#because there are multiple census tracts for one zip code, use the res_ratio to allocate what portion of the count of SGIP applications should be allocated to one census tract\nsgip_zip_census <- left_join(sgip_zip_2020, crosswalk, by = \"zip\") |> \n  mutate(\"count_adjusted\" = count*res_ratio) #now we have theoretical count of applications per census tract\n\n#combine sgip_zip_census with acs data by tract\ncombined_all <- left_join(sgip_zip_census, combine_census, by = \"tract\") |> \n  mutate(\"percapita_application\" = count_adjusted/population) |>\n  mutate(\"applications_per_thousand\" = (count_adjusted/population)*1000) |>\n  mutate(\"log_income\" = log(percapita_income)) |> \n  mutate(\"income_group\" = ifelse(percapita_income <= 48800, \"low income\", \"not low income\")) |> \n  select(c(-\"oth_ratio\", -\"tot_ratio\", -\"bus_ratio\"))#low income in CA for 2020 48,800 threshold\n\n#take the combined_all data frame and consolidate back to apps per zip (averaging per capita income and summing population of each census tract into zip codes)\ncombined_by_zip <- combined_all |> \n  group_by(zip) |> \n  summarize(applications = mean(count, na.rm = TRUE), percapita_income = mean(percapita_income, na.rm = TRUE), population = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE)) |> \n  filter(!is.na(percapita_income)) |> \n  mutate(\"applications_per_1000_people\" = (applications/population)*1000, \"percapita_application\" = applications/population)\n\n\n\nRegression Models\nNext, I ran different regression models to see what would best fit the data. I tried a simple linear regression, linear-log regression, log-log regression and polynomial regression. I concluded that the polynomial regression was best fit since visually the slope doesn’t look constant and the coefficients were significant. Here is the equation for the model:\n\\[application_i =\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\cdot income_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot income_i^2 + \\varepsilon_i\\]\nI did notice that there was an outlier in the dataset, but when I removed the outlier and ran the polynomial regression it did not change the significance level of the coefficients. Because the outlier didn’t drastically change model results and there was no evidence that this data point was and outlier caused by data entry or measurement errors, I left it in.\nOne notable limitation is that on all the models tested, including the polynomial regression, the residuals were not normally distributed with a long right tail. This means that the amount of error in the model is not consistent across the full range of my observed data and predictive accuracy of the model may be low.\n\n\nHypothesis Testing\nAdditionally, I jointly tested the \\(\\beta_{1}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) coefficients using the linearHypothesis() function from the car package to test for no relationship between per capita income and applications per thousand people.\n\\(H_0: \\beta_{1} = 0, \\beta_{2} = 0\\)\n\\(H_A: \\beta_{j}\\neq 0\\) for at least one \\(j = 1,2\\)\n\n\n\nResults\n\nPolynomial Regression\nFrom the below outputs of the model, I can see that the coefficient of per capita income is statistically significant at the 1% significance level (p-value = .001) and the coefficient of per capita income squared is statistically significant at the 5% significance level (p-value = 0.019). The R squared and adjusted R squared are really low at 0.017 and 0.016, respectively. This means that 1.6% of the variability in applications per thousand people is explained by per capita income. Having a low R squared value and a high significance for the coefficients in the model could mean that there is a statistically significant relationship between applications and income, but the predictive power of the model is low.\n\n\ncheckout the code\n#polynomial regression\npoly_model <- lm(applications_per_1000_people ~ percapita_income + I(percapita_income^2), data = combined_by_zip)\n\n#store all the values of the model \nR2_poly_model = summary(poly_model)$r.squared\nR2_poly_adjusted = summary(poly_model)$adj.r.squared\n\nintercept_poly <- summary(poly_model)$coefficients[\"(Intercept)\", \"Estimate\"]\nb1_poly <- summary(poly_model)$coefficients[\"percapita_income\", \"Estimate\"]\nb2_poly <- summary(poly_model)$coefficients[\"I(percapita_income^2)\", \"Estimate\"]\n\nPredictors <- c(\"Intercept\", \"per capita income\", \"(per capita income)^2\")\nEstimate <- signif(summary(poly_model)$coefficients[,\"Estimate\"], digits = 3)\nSE <- signif(summary(poly_model)$coefficients[,\"Std.

When moving from a per capita income of 60,000 to 70,000 (middle income), predicted applications per thousand people decreases by 0.06.

It is hard to definitely say that the SGIP program is or is not helping lower income communities since the slope of the model increases up until a certain point and then decreases. From previous research mentioned in the introduction, I would have thought the slope of the model would be consistently positive. This would have shown that the SGIP program was being utilized less by low income. The model does, however, conclude that the lowest income communities are not utilizing the SGIP program. This can be due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, energy storage systems often being paired with solar, requirements of home ownership, and a lengthy rebate process that are barriers to adoption of this program. Some further analysis that would help determine if the equity and equity resiliency funding is helping low income communities is to compare pre 2020 applications to post 2020 applications to get a sense of if this funding changed rebate participation among lower income communities. Also adding medical vulnerability and wildfire risk as predictors to the model to see if those communities are utilizing the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBlair, Nate, Chad Augustine, Wesley Cole, et al. 2022.

Michelle graduated from Santa Clara University in 2017 with a B.S. in Environmental Science with an emphasis on water, energy, and technology. During her time at Santa Clara, she worked for a municipal utility promoting energy efficiency programs, which sparked her interest in renewable energy and sustainability in the built environment. After graduating, she further delved into the renewable energy sector working as a Business Systems Analyst for a residential solar company. In that role, she gained first-hand experience managing and using data in various business applications to drive decisions while expanding her knowledge of the solar industry. With her master’s degree, she hopes to use data science to further the development of renewable energy and help businesses and organizations create a sustainable built environment."
