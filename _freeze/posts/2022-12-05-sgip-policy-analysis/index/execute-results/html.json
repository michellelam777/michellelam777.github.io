[^1] The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) created the Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), in part, to provide rebates to people and organizations looking to install energy storage systems. In 2020, they introduced new funding categories that provide higher rebates under \"Equity\" and \"Equity Resilience\" aimed to help lower-income, medically vulnerable, and at risk for fire communities pay for a battery. [^2] Given that lower socioeconomic communities are shown to experience more frequent Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS), [^3] an energy storage system could be critical to avoiding the adverse effects of a power outage (e.g. food insecurity).\n\nExamining if there is an effect of income on SGIP application, could help inform the effectiveness of this rebate program and subsequent policy decisions.\n:::\n\n[^1]: Blair, Nate, Chad Augustine, Wesley Cole, et al. 2022.

For this analysis, SGIP applications were filtered down to just residential battery applications for 2020. The data was then summarized by zip code to get total count of applications for each zip code.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#loading the necessary pacakges\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n#setting file path for root directory\nrootdir <- (\"/Users/michelle/Documents/UCSB Grad School/Courses/eds_222/eds222_final_project\")\ndatadir <-(file.path(rootdir,\"data\"))\n\n#store and set API key to access tidycensus\ncensus_token <- Sys.getenv('CENSUS_KEY')\ncensus_api_key(census_token)\n```\n:::\n",
